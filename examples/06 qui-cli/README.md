# Use the qui-cli plugin

This [script](./src/index.ts) is identical to the [basic-use](../01%20basic-use#readme), except it's written taking advantage of the [@oauth2-cli/qui-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oauth2-cli/qui-cli) plugin for [qui-cli](https://github.com/battis/qui-cli#readme) command line app development. All configuration values are drawn directly from the environment.
